# CODEified - The Freedom Project

## Blockchain Based Decentralized Democratic Governance Through Transparent and Automated Aggregation of Individually CODEified Constitutions

### An Overview

The Freedom Project is a multi-faceted idea to help remake government for the 21st century.  It is, at its core, based upon transparent, direct democracy.  Open discussion with people governing directly through voting, where majority rules.  The major difference is that it seeks to create a decentralized structure.  All governments, up to this point have been created from the top-down.  This is where we will break with tradition.  We will seek to form an organization from the bottom up.  Grassroots.  One based upon upward delegation of authority instead of downward delegation of responsibility.  Technology will help us make this happen.
With that in mind, everything in this document is simply my opinion of how this thing could work.  My best guess of how to organize our discussion and frame the a new Constitution.  I am not arrogant enough to assume that I can do this by myself, nor that everything in here is “correct” or “fact.”  It is simply my understanding of this idea.  An idea I was blessed with having, but it could have been gifted to anyone.  This is just where I have chosen to start.  I pose that everything in this document, and the project should be open source and up for vote.
The Framework, CODEified, is the organization structure for the Constitution we are creating, not the law of the land.  Just the framework to house each of our documents as well as the jointly CODEified Constitution.  This is a critical idea that I will explain further.  The other big piece of things is the discussion forum, ShareDiscussion, for us to have a Constitutional Convention for the 21st (and beyond?) century.  The third piece of things will be a digital representation of us.  The user database is a persistent social-media-styled information source that will house our public records (think passport, violations, legal documents and tax records).  Together all of these things will work together to make up The Freedom Project.

### The Preamble
“We the People, in Order to find a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution.”


The Preamble to the Constitution is a marvel even today and is as relevant as ever.  Beautiful in its simplicity and thoroughness.  It encompasses government’s purpose. Nothing more and nothing less.  This is the end goal of The Freedom Project.  Nothing more and nothing less.  Thorough enough to cover all the necessities of a complex world and simple enough to fully understand so our interest in participation persists.  A solid foundation upon which we can build, yet flexible to recognise that mistakes are made and opinions can change.  After all we are human; all of us…  We the People are just a group of humans standing in the shadow of something greater than ourselves.

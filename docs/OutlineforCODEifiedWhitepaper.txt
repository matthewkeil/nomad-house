The Basis
* Must be simple so everyone can understand to their own ability
* Must allow for complexity to represent governance of complex civilization
* Must be transparent
* Must be secure
* Must allow for malleability over time as individuals and society change
* Must be a common point of unity from which all can relate. Shared cause.
* Must adequately balance needs of the individual and needs of the many
* Must adequately aggregate the Will individuals to accurately generate Will of the People
* Shared understanding is critical for common ground
* We all need a reason to follow “the rules.”  If they are based on our own it becomes easier to understand
* Laws and lawmaking should be transparent
* Government should do no more and no less that we specify
* Only laws placed within the framework will be applicable
* 

Abstraction for Idea->Law modeling
* Based neurobiology to most closely mimic human understanding of the world
* Talk about the lens of perception and how it affects the behavior of the individual
* Ideas are fundamental quantities
* Understanding allows us to use ideas as building blocks for more complex ideas
* Beliefs are ideas we hold “true” and can be built upon
* Because understanding is critical you must show that you have taken each idea as a belief, through understanding, and then you choose to hold it as a principle that guides you.
* Principles are beliefs that guide our behavior. A rule that we live our life by, even when nobody's watching
* Rules are beliefs that the individual will always adhere to, whether qualified as law (see below) or not, and should also be used as a principle others must live by even if they do not understand nor believe it themself.
* Laws are rules that have met the democratic criteria for becoming law within a given jurisdiction. The system will aggregate individual will to the appropriate jurisdiction.
* Individuals CODEify the principles by which they choose to live their life
* Only as rules become law will the individual need to guide their actions by ideas other than principles they hold.
* As ideas are CODEified they will propagate through the system and notify oters


Bottom up structure and self-organizing jurisdictions
* Begins with a government of one.
* Jurisdiction are groups of individuals with similar beliefs 
* Jurisdictions are by choice
* Jurisdictions will form based on shared principles
* Aggregation at its core will be based upon geographical location for each idea
* Individual Will shall aggregate to shared Will for each idea.
* * Aggregation of will for one idea will aggregate subordinate ideas unless subordinates are explicitly delegated separately
================
* The individual my choose a “home” location
* The system will track to both “home” and “current” locations to assess aggregated Will




How does it all get started?
* Begins with a government of one. Tell parable of deserted island
* We all pull ideas from the “idea pool” and choose how to incorporate them into our codeified document
* Each person CODEifies the law that they choose to live by.
* When a section is CODEified it is understood that all other sections sub-headed under said section will be 
* All you need to do to particpate is to CODEify the preamble. It is the only part that needs to be understood to join.


Design of the Organization Structure
* Each item within The Preamble will lead be its own heading
* Ideas will be placed within the framework based on where the individual chooses
* Guidance will be provided by the discussion of the idea and suggestions of where others have placed the same idea
* Ideas placed under a heading will be covered by CODEification of said heading.
* If a heading is CODEified it will be assumed that all headings are CODEified
* Understanding of contained ideas is not necessary for a heading to be CODEified
* It will be assumed that the more specific an idea, the more granular the required understanding will be for said idea
* Government should represent our shared beliefs
* Shared beliefs are based on individual beliefs
* Upward delegation will used instead of traditional downward delegation
* Shared will leads to broader implementation of said idea
* Aggregation will allow for will to be transferred up to the appropriate jurisdiction


Subordination, Predecessors and Dependencies
* Ideas filed under other ideas will be considered subordinate
* Ideas built upon beliefs are dependent
* Beliefs that allow other for belief of other ideas are predecessors


Constitutional Discussion
* All ideas will have a discussion attached to them.
* The system will use importance weighting to highlight most “interesting aspects”
* Individual ideas will be assessed through a Discussion
* Those with more informed backgrounds on a topic will 
* 

Transparency and Surety of Identity and Will
* Must be identifiable as an individual
* Tied to indifv


Delegation of Responsibility
* As principles are CODEified the individual may choose to execute responsibility or delegate responsibility upward.
* Laws may authorize delegation toward higher jurisdictions


Inheritance of Codification
* “When you live under my roof you live by my rules
* Those too young will live under the rule of their guardian until they can codeify their own constitution 


Transparency of Individual Principles and Representation
* Must be tied to the individual
* Transparency of identity during discussion
* You have the right to vote, abstain or delegate your will
* You have the right to have your belief and principle shown or held private
* Rules are public (lead by example)
* You have the right to show, or hold private whom you’ve delegated your will
* Your “representation” will be based upon your choices above
* Jurisdictional representation will be based upon the aggregation of the will within said jurisdiction
* All delegation shall be done upward through aggregation of will
